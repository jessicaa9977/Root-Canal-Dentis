First, you have to understand somewhat about the body of a tooth. The actual root canal is inside of the root of your tooth. The center is the pulp chamber, based on Wikipedia, within the tooth. The contents of the canal is known as pulp and provides blood flow to the tooth itself. Additionally, there are nerves at the artery, supplying pain and sensitivity when inflammation presses on the nerve. The procedure known as a root canal cleans out this canal and remove the infected pulp. The pulp is not required once the tooth is mature, so there isn’t any negative effects of having the pulp removed.  The dentist will first anesthetize you so you won’t sense anything. Then a little hole will be drilled at the crown of the tooth and down to the pulp. After the canal has been cleaned out, the pulp is going to be replaced with material quite much like the substance used at a filling. This substance is known as gutta-percha. Then the hole at the crown of the tooth is filled with filling substance, but the crown is going to be replaced with an artificial crown over approximately six weeks.
